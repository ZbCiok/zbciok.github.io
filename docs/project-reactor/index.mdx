# Project Reactor
### [*More information...*](https://jreact.com/index.php/project-reactor/)


### Create Efficient Reactive Systems
Reactor is a fourth-generation reactive library, based on the Reactive Streams specification, for building non-blocking applications on the JVM

### Efficient Message Passing
Reactor operators and schedulers can sustain high throughput rates, on the order of 10’s of millions of messages per second. Its low memory footprint goes under most radars. Reactor Core is the first reactive library based on the joint reactive research effort also implemented by RxJava 2.

### A Micro Reactive Toolkit for All
Don’t write Reactive Streams yourself! Reactor’s modules are embeddable and interoperable. They focus on providing rich and functional Reactive Streams APIs. You can use Reactor at any level of granularity:
- in frameworks such as Spring Boot and WebFlux
- in drivers and clients such as the CloudFoundry Java Client
- in contracts or protocols such as RSocket and R2DBC
